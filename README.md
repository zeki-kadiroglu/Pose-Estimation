# pose-estimation
- By Using `Mediapipe` and `OpenCV` library, created a project named `Gym Pose Estimation`.
- Firstly, AI model detects a human then detects the body's joint points such as elbow, wrist, shoulder.
- Secondly, Thanks to `MediaPipe-landmark` feature, we found the coordinate of body's joint points which is used to calculate the angle of 3 joint points.
- Ultimately, by utilizing the computed angle, the application is able to count how many curl has been done by trainee and display on screen.
